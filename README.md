# Krishi Connect 🌾

## Description
Krishi Connect is a responsive digital support system for farmers. It provides real-time features like weather forecasts, crop disease detection through images, agro news, and more — helping farmers make smarter decisions.

Originally adapted from FDSS (Farmer Digital Support System), this app is built with React and Tailwind CSS, and optimized for both desktop and mobile use.
